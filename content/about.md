Iâ€™m passionate about using modern Front-end technologies with accessible design to build responsive, highly performant and pleasing user experiences for everyone. As a developer I like to follow agile principals in all my work and it has been the key part to the success of large scale projects I've worked on.

When not working with clients I like to read comics, cook with my wife, and build applications to automate my workflow.
