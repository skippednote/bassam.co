After many [attempts](http://mirnazim.org/notes/jkdevnet-begins/) we finally have a community for developers in Kashmir. Kashmir is still under a rock when it comes to contributing to the web or embracing it's openness and we are here to counter that.

Couple of months back I wouldn't have imagined to see a web developer in Kashmir and last saturday I was sitting with eleven of them. I got really excited when [*Aliya* ](https://twitter.com/Aliya_Khan)told me that we might be having a meetup on the weekend and we did, the first **Open Source Srinagar** meetup. We were joined by people from three companies and a freelancer. I had a wonderful time -- meeting fellow developers, great discussions and a good food.

**Open Source Srinagar** is a collective. A group of passionate web designers and developers, aiming to spread awarness in the society. **Open Source Srinagar** is an initiative by three companies: *Axelerant*, *Applied Informatics*, *iKarft*, who are working from Kashmir. We invite people who are interested and willing to contribute to the society. We plan to share our experiences to let intrested people have a better understanding of how computers & the web works and more importantly how our work helps in shaping it. How Open Source softwares and libraries provide the flexibilty that we can't imagine in a closed environments.

So, what exactly happened at the meetup? Well, we all got together at the [Peerzoo Island](https://maps.google.co.in/maps?q=peerzoo&hl=en&ll=34.071209,74.823742&spn=0.001206,0.002411&sll=34.080971,74.803757&sspn=1.235227,2.469177&hq=peerzoo&t=h&z=19) to talk about Open Source, how it is a part of our workflow. Shared our plans, how we will work towards engaging a larger audience and get them involved.

For the next meetup, we have planned a hackthon where a pair of a developer and a designer will work out an app, plugin, website or an animated gif; anything that involes code.

You can approach us using our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OpenSourceSrinagar) till we setup a proper website and a mailing address. We look forward to a larger turn out this time.
