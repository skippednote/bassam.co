I would love to know your thoughts on this process, if one should take a different route. Whether Javascript is the right way to go or should one switch to Python/Ruby. Though Javascript would helpful for a web designer/Frontend-dev. Are there any other technoloies involved that I should add in here. I would appreciate if you help with some ideas, workflows,links for getting started.

Rebecaa Murphy has written an useful Baseline guide for Front-end developer, which will help you figure where you stand and what to learn next.
