Working for the web? Me too! I have been working as a Front-End developer for around two years and it has been an amazing experience. The fascinating thing is that I'm always excited to learn something new.

If you have just started working for the web, let me tell you that the journey only gets better as you improve. Learning a new language or diving into Illustrator from Photoshop might seem overwhelming at first but these things always pay off. Gaining new skills will not only make you a better professional but it is one of the most crucial part of moving forward, so better gear up.

Learning by looking into others work and forking it is a great practice. It not only teaches you how something is done/made, but it will hone your skills and inspire you to make something propitious. Commenting on blogs, questioning why something is done in a particular way or sharing insights with your co-worker is a great way to learn something new.

Web evolves at a very fast pace and staying updated about the latest advancements is very important. It might be keeping up with the updates in your favourite programming language or finding a way to use CSS instead of tables for layout or finding a typeface better than Comic Sans MS. For starters I would recommend subscribing to newsletters, reading industry recognised blogs, following gurus on Twitter and socialising in related communities (online and offline).

Creating something like a framework, grid or even a snippet of code will boost your skills and mindset towards building things. Sharing your work with the community by posting on social sites like GitHub so that everyone else can use it and make it better is a great way to become a part of the community. Getting social within the community always helps you whenever you get stuck and opens a vast number of opportunities.

Maintaining a blog and posting whatever you learn or even your thoughts on how something should be done helps you and your readers alike. It also aids your communication skills; win-win in every way. Never let the fear of making mistakes stop you from posting on your blog, we learn from our mistakes and should be always prepared to improve/correct ourselves. Once you get better your blog might even help you afford a cup of coffee.

We have one of the best jobs; heck it's not even a job, it's something delightful. So go ahead learn something new, write a blogpost about it, share something on GitHub and help a new comer.
