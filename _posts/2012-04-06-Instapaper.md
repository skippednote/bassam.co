We don't need ads, get rid of the stupid sidebar. These comments are useless too, just people praising each other and no useful information. Wrong!

Comments are an essential part of a blog, readers feedback improves the content to a great extent and these discussions are mostly productive. Instapaper, Readability and even Read it Later, none of these apps support comments. This is bad, really missing on a great feature.

Recently I came across a post on Daniel Howells's blog about  [Svbtle vs Obtvse](http://howells.ws/posts/view/93/svbtle-vs-obtvse-and-on-copying) mess, Frank Chimero had posted a [comment](http://howells.ws/posts/view/93/svbtle-vs-obtvse-and-on-copying#comment-156) on the it. This made the post much more insightful than it was before.

This is not to say that it is all fault of these apps that just show the main content and neglect the comments. Most of the times comments are filled with garabe and they need a voting system (some blogs already have that). But having a option to turn ON comments will always be great.

Comments are like spices, they not only make food tastier but also add value to it.
