This post has been sitting in the drafts folder for a while now and it’s nothing like what I basically wanted it to be. It was just the frustration that I wanted to blurb out, nothing more.

Today while scrolling down my twitter timeline, I came across a video from Fluent Conf 13 in which Nicolas Zakas talks about how a “Thank You” changed the course of his life. How chain of events led him to become a well known author of several books, all due to gratitude.

I, with whatever amount of knowledge I have love to help others. Building and breaking stuff together. Hacking on new shit.

Lately I came to a realization that I was loosing too much time with all this. Things weren’t moving at the pace I wanted them to. I was getting burned out.

I was wrong, I love this. I OCD at this. I get a kick out of it.

For me it has been rewarding all along.I have met awesome people, scored several amazing gigs and gained a ton of knowledge all this time.

I learnt that the more I help people or rather try to help people I get way much more in return. So win-win for everyone + satisfaction.

Thats why love the Open Source community, people have been doing this for decades now. Building amazing things and sharing them for free with the community, taking time to help other, spending nights fixing issues and what not.

Try it for yourself and who know you might get to ride the unicorn. Get filthy rich $$$.

BTW, Unicorn = 1000+ star and around 100+ forks

Also whats better than working with your homies? Getting together and creating something. Working on something you passionately love.

We are working on a platform where a contributor is 100x valuable than a co-founder. A platform where a bunch of people can get together and build something that can change how we perceive things.

It hardly matter if the thing you work on doesn’t chart the front page on Hacker News. You aren’t getting paid, so you can’t get fired either.Well actually it does matter but the time you spend with the people you work with is well worth it.

It’s okay to spend couple of late hours after work if you get to be a catalyst in someones or somethings growth.

>Be excellent to each other.
