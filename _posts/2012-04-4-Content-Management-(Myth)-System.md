CMSes are tacky to build on. We mostly use wordpress, take a stripped down theme like Starker and build on it. To be fair, I’m not fond of the idea, I want something that has less automation but more control even if it costs some features. Something that is more tangible, that one can keep under control, tame to a fair amount.

I built this site using a file based CMS called Scriptogram which stores content in my Dropbox folder. I can write posts in iA Writer from my iPad and they will be automatically posted as a new page/post. Now what more can one ask? Ability to use a great text editor and no hassle of going through various interfaces, that's what we all wanted but couldn’t figure over thousands of shiny buttons. Writing Markdown instead of HTML means no more syntax bombardment in a text editor.

Losing functionality here is all about gaining more control and concentrating on the most crucial part of the Internet, the Content.
