Before I start ranting about my personal experience of Kashmir's first Hackathon, here is an excerpt from Paul Graham's brilliant post explaining what Hacking in it real sense mean:

>To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wantsâ€”whether the computer wants to or not.
> <cite>Paul Graham</cite>

I consider myself lucky to be a part of the Open Source Srinagar community, especially working with the Axelerant team where I have colleagues like [Junaid Masoodi](http://www.twitter.com/junaidmasudi).

Props to [Aliya Khan](http://www.twitter.com/Aliya_Khan), Lead at Axelerant Srinagar office and *Ishan Khan* for putting in tons of effort to make this event happen. They organized the event in a really short time; inviting people, getting banners and stickers printed, arranging food and lots of other stuff. *Aliya* took the initial steps to setup the OSS community and has brought us thus far.

[*Aamir Hussain*](http://aamirhussain.com/), co-fouder **Applied Informatics** had proposed the idea of having a Hackathon during the last **Open Source Srinagar** [meetup](http://skippednote.com/post/open-source-srinagar) and everyone shook their head in agreement. Exactly a week later we hosted the Hackathon at Applied Informatics/Axelerant office. We had a great turn out, freshers as well as people from various companies showed up despite some local problems restricting movement.

We hacked up an Open Source Srinagar website and a chat app to go with that. Newsletter and print magazine were designed for the **Open Source Srinagar** community.

###Take aways
* Collaborate. The sole reason of a Hackathon is to get people together and build a community around them. You get to socialise, learn how people work and help each other.
* You are not the final authority. Learn to give constructive feedback, feedback will help you get better, ALWAYS.
* Plan and start coding. Hackathon isn't your routine client work, so gear up and start building.
* Frameworks and Preprocessors are your friends. I know most of the front-end developers and designers loathe things like readymade templates and modules yet no one will judge the code quality at a Hackathon, just the final product.
* Use version control if you want something substantial at the end of the day. We had teams working on the different projects and sharing files using Git became a breeze.
* Try something new while staying on the safe side. It's a great opportunity to learn a new programming language or an enhancement tool.

We look forward to organizing similar events that help the creative minds get together. You can be a part of the [community](https://www.facebook.com/OpenSourceSrinagar) as well.
