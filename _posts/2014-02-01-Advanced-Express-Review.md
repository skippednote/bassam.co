People from Packtpub got in touch sometime back to review the latest book on Advanced Express Web Application Development written by Andrew Keig. Keep in mind this isn't a book for beginners. You should have a good working knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.

The book takes a test driven development approach from the start, with test for all the features mentioned using technologies like Mocha, superagent, jsconverge, cucumber and more. The book covers a lot of technologies used in development and production like automated testing using Grunt, setting up persistance using MongoDB, scaling using Redis and real-time using Socket.io. The app we build use Backbone.js on the client-side and authentication.

The dives deep into creating secure application using Passport. Smaller components like Templating language, package managers, configuration management have been dealt throughly throughout the book. The finally chapter goes over how to setup app for production environment, which involves topics like Caching, compressing and minfication of files, logging, and sessions.

It is a quick read and there are hardly any negative for this book. Highly recommended for people who are looking to brush up there Express.js skill and learn some more advanced topics like test driven development and making application real-time.
