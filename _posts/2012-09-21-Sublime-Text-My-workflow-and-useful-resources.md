After using *Sublime Text* for more than a year, spending most of the day in the app, I think its time that I write a post about it. Today I'll share my workflow and some useful resources for Sublime Text.

###Why I use it

- I use Sublime Text 2 on my Desktop (Windows/Linux) and on my *MacBook* (OS X), which is the great thing about it, *cross-platfrom support*.
- Performance wise its really fast, Chrome like fast. Quickest startup amongst the popular code editors.
- It supports a huge active userbase and is recommened by people like [Paul Irish](http://www.twitter.com/paul_irish), [Addy Osmani](http://www.twitter.com/addyosmani), and several other hot-shot developers we follow.
- It has a huge number of packages (extensions) with includes Text Mate bundles too. Package Control being one of the most useful one.
- Powerful support for *Custom Build* systems. You can create your custom builds for pushing code to Git/FTP, setting up SASS/LESS directories, running lint on a directory/file, compiling scripts, etc.
- Beautiful UI. Coda being a tight competition, however I find Sublime Text 2's UI better for working with.

###Packages I userbase

- HTML5 package for the new tags that were added in the HTML5 specification.
- Package Control, one of the most important bundle. For easily adding and removing bundles.
- CodeIntel for code completion, supports several programming languages.
- Nettuts+ Fetch for fetching files like CSS reset, libraries like jQuery, Angular.js, Backbone.js, etc and development packages too (HTML5 Boilerplate and Foundation by Zurb).
- SideBarEnhancement for added functionality. I can create a new files in a project, rename them, open files in a browser, etc.
- ZenCoding for getting markup done quicker though I sometimes switch to HAML.
- Soda Theme with Tomorrow color scheme. This is the best looking combination I have come across yet. I use Ubuntu Mono/Melno as default font.
- Since I've switched from vanilla CSS to preprocessors I use SASS and LESS packages for code highlighting.

###[Reindenting Text](http://joshbetz.com/2012/09/reindent-text-in-sublime/)

Add the following code to the Key Binding- users. Make sure not to change the Key Binding- Default or you will loose these changes next time you update Sublime Text.
