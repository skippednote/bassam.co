Blank canvas is one of the most horrifying thing for a designer or developer. This might not be the case for everyone but most us will agree on this. To start building something isn't simple, unless some ground-breaking idea stuck you while taking a shower.

Taking a break or concentrating on something other than work might be helpful sometimes but not always, this won't always light up a idea in your brain. However this doesn't mean that one must stops pushing his limits, the more effort you put in, the better your work is.

Choosing the best idea and converting it into the next big startup is a lot of hard work. But where does that idea come from? The key to build something to be proud of is to stay motivated and have a solid strategy. Inspirations come from others work, everything is inspired. Something to note here is being inspired has nothing to do with copying someone else's work.

So instead of jumping directly into a code editor or photoshop, one must build a workflow first on how to go about things. This will not only save lots of time but the work will be streamlined. Therefore better results.
