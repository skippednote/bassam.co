          I will help you by auditing your current workflow and reviewing the
          existing codebase. This would be followed up by a detailed document
          that would highlight all the areas of improvement and how you go about
          incorporating the suggested solutions.

        <Paragraph>
          I can also help you with laying the foundation of your project,
          planning out the sprint zero, and development for the initial phase.
          Iâ€™m not a fan of diving into time constrained project where most of
          the time is spent bugs fixing.

          I can help train your team members to be better front-end developers

          could be a workshop running for few days or recurring meeting with
          individual team members over an extended period.

          development workflow, Unix CLI, Git and Agile principles for
